# Project Rules

These are laws, not suggestions. If a proposed feature violates any rule below, it is rejected.

## 1. WHAT THE GAME MUST NEVER INCLUDE

**Forbidden Elements:**
- No score, points, or any numerical measurement
- No timer, countdown, or time pressure of any kind
- No winning condition
- No losing condition
- No game over screen
- No levels, stages, or progression system
- No achievements, unlockables, or rewards
- No punishment, penalty, or negative feedback
- No urgency in any form
- No dialogue
- No instructions
- No tutorials
- No tooltips explaining what to do
- No "correct" way to play
- No quests, objectives, or missions
- No fail states

**If any of these are proposed, the answer is no.**

## 2. WHAT THE GAME MUST ALWAYS PROTECT

**Non-Negotiable Protections:**
- **Calm and emotional safety** — The player must never feel threatened, judged, or pressured
- **Player freedom with no obligation** — The player may choose to interact or do nothing. Both are equally valid
- **Slow pacing** — Nothing should rush the player. Time belongs to them.
- **Gentle feedback** — All responses to player action must be soft. Nothing should startle or demand attention
- **Optionality** — Every interaction must be optional. The player can ignore everything.

---

## 3. DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

**All features must satisfy these constraints:**

- **Every interaction must feel optional** — The player must never feel required to act
- **Visuals must remain soft and non-intrusive** — No flashing, shaking, jarring movements, or bright aggressive colors
- **Sounds must remain gentle** — No sudden loud noises, alarms, or harsh audio. Everything fades in and out softly
- **If a feature creates stress, it must be removed** — Stress of any kind is a failure condition. No exceptions.

**Interaction Design:**
- The player should be able to do nothing and still have a valid experience
- There is no "right" interaction and no "wrong" interaction
- Nothing breaks and nothing needs fixing
- The game state should never communicate "you should be doing something"

---

## 4. DECISION RULE

**The one question that decides everything:**

> Does this feature serve calm, curiosity, or emotional release?

**If yes:** Consider inclusion, but verify it does not violate other rules.

**If no:** It does not belong in this game.

This rule applies to:
- New features
- Visual effects
- Audio design
- UI elements
- Interaction systems
- Any design decision

---

## ENFORCEMENT

These rules exist to prevent project drift. The game's identity is its emotional core. Anything that threatens that core is out of scope.

When in doubt, refer back to `product.md`. If a feature contradicts the product vision, it is rejected.

**These rules are permanent.**
