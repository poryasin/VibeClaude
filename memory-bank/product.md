# Product Vision

## What This Game Is

A quiet, emotionally-driven digital experience. A gentle space that exists simply to be. A place where nothing is required of you.

This game is for people who feel:
- Tired
- Bored
- Confused
- Empty

It is a digital safe space where you can interact freely without pressure, instructions, or expectations.

## What This Game Is NOT

This is NOT:
- A challenge to be overcome
- A competition with scores or rankings
- Something to win or lose
- A puzzle that needs solving
- Something that is broken and needs fixing
- A test of skill or reflex

There are no failures here. There is no way to do this wrong.

## Core Emotional Goal

The game should feel:
- Calm
- Gentle
- Slightly melancholic
- Safe

The emotional experience is the entire point. There is no hidden objective. There is no next level. There is only now, and how it feels to be here.

## The Player Experience We Protect

We protect the player's right to:
- Exist without purpose
- Interact without understanding
- Explore without goals
- Rest without guilt
- Leave and return without consequence

Nothing demands their attention. Nothing judges their inaction. The game waits patiently, unchanged, whenever they choose to return.

This is a space where it is okay to simply be.
