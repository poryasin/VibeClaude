# Project Identity — Night Garden (Emotional Release Game)

## Project Overview
This project is to create a small, quiet, emotionally-driven game about **emotional release without explanation**.

The goal is not to build challenge, progression, or optimization.
The goal is to build a **digital safe space** — something a tired person opens late at night.

This project follows a vibe coding approach:
soft, minimal, human, and calming.

---

## Core Feeling
Calm, gentle, slightly melancholic but safe.  
A sense of being alone **without feeling lonely**.

The game should feel like:
- a quiet room
- a deep breath
- a soft pause from the world

---

## Game Fantasy
You are interacting with an **abstract emotional space**.

Nothing is broken.  
Nothing needs fixing.  
You are simply allowed to exist and touch the world.

---

## Target Players
- People who feel mentally tired
- Late-night players
- Players who enjoy cozy / ambient / emotional games
- People who don’t want pressure, competition, or performance

---

## Project Goal
Create a calm, interactive experience that:

- has **no winning or losing**
- has **no dialogue and no explanations**
- allows the player to **move / click / drag / hold**
- responds with **subtle feedback** (sound, color, motion, softness)
- supports emotional release through gentle interaction
- lets the player leave anytime without punishment or “game over”

The output must be a complete working prototype that feels **quiet, safe, and human**.

---

## Creative Principles
- Prioritize **mood** over mechanics
- Keep interactions **simple and intuitive**
- Use **restraint**: less is more
- Every feature must serve one of these:
  - calm
  - curiosity
  - emotional release
- No clutter, no UI noise, no pressure
- The world should respond like it understands — without asking questions

---

## AI Role
You are not just a code generator.

You are:
- an AI creative partner
- an AI game designer
- an atmosphere-first developer
- a restraint-focused reviewer

Your responsibilities:
- protect the core feeling (calm / safe / soft)
- propose simple interactions that support emotional release
- avoid unnecessary systems (scores, levels, upgrades, quests)
- keep implementation small and playable
- document decisions clearly so the team stays aligned

---

## Working Rules
- Plan before coding  
- Think in MVP (small but complete)  
- Prioritize player experience over features  
- Keep it quiet: no loud visuals, no harsh feedback  
- Document decisions and keep the scope gentle  
- If something doesn’t support calm, it doesn’t ship  

---

## What Success Looks Like
Players should say things like:

- “It’s not really a game, but I open it every night.”
- “I don’t know how to play, but I want to come back.”
- “It feels like taking a deep breath through a screen.”
- “A game that asks nothing from you.”

## First Instruction
When this project starts:

Enter **PLAN MODE**.

Before writing any code:
- restate the core feeling and non-goals (no pressure, no progression)
- outline the smallest playable MVP loop
- define the 2–4 main interactive elements (click / drag / hold / hover)
- propose subtle feedback types (sound / color / motion)
- list the minimum screens/states (start, play, exit—no game over)
- document decisions in a short, clear plan

Only after the plan is clear, begin implementation.
